To configure ONTAP storage for FLI migration, you should wire the source storage into the fabric based on your planning information and recommended best practices.

The following wiring best practices are recommended when configuring ONTAP storage for FLI migration.

* Use dual fabrics for redundancy.
* Use at least two initiators and two target ports from each destination storage for FLI migration.
* Do not zone destination storage initiator ports with the host. Initiator ports of ONTAP are used to zone with target ports of source storage.

The following is an example of wiring for source storage and destination storage in a production fabric.
