This section provides examples of post-migration tasks for all FLI workflows. Post-migration tasks include removing source LUNs from your host and removing source storage and host zone from your zoneset.

All of the post-migration tasks listed use an _HDS AMS2100_ array in the examples. Your tasks may be different if you are using a different array or a different version of the array GUI.
