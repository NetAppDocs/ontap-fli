For planning purposes certain assumptions can be used to estimate the level of effort and duration of data migrations.

To get an accurate estimate of your actual performance, you should run a number of test migrations of different sizes in order to get accurate performance numbers for your specific environments.

[NOTE]
====
The following benchmarks are strictly for planning purposes and are unlikely to be particularly accurate for specific environments.

Assumptions: Five hours per host migration based on a host with 8 LUNs with a total of 2 TB of data. These parameters provide a planning number of approximately 400 GB per hour.
