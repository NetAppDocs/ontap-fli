A Foreign LUN Import (FLI) implementation includes the steps for physical wiring, zoning, and initiator record creation. The initial configuration of the NetApp storage initiator ports and source storage prepares the environment for migration.

The examples in this section use a Hitachi Data Systems (HDS) AMS array, and therefore the foreign array commands will differ depending on the third-party array from which you are migrating.
