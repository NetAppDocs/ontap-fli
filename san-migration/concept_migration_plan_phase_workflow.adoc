The planning phase of the data migration process focuses on tasks required to create detailed migration plans and to make sure that everything is ready for the actual migration. The majority of migration work is the planning performed during this phase.

The planning phase is where you develop a remediation plan using the host gap analysis information gathered in the analysis phase. Use the host remediation information while planning. After end-to-end connectivity is verified, a test migration is performed to make sure everything is properly configured before beginning the production migration.

The following figure shows the plan workflow.
