[.lead]
In an FLI offline migration, the client system is taken offline during data migration from the third party foreign storage array to the NetApp storage system. 

.Before you begin

* You should complete the link:concept_migration_discover_phase_workflow.html[discovery], link:concept_migration_analyze_phase_workflow.html[analysis], and link:concept_migration_plan_phase_workflow.html[planning] phases of the migration process. 
* You should link:configure-fc-adapter-initiator.html[configure your FC adapters for initiator mode].
* You should link:concept_target_and_initiator_port_zoning.html:[zone your foreign array target ports with the ONTAP storage initiator ports].

.About this task
FLI offline migration is a process that involves several key steps to ensure a successful migration of data from third-party storage arrays to NetApp storage systems. The workflow includes preparing the hosts and foreign LUNs for import, creating the LUN import relationship, and importing the data.

Before you perform an FLI offline migration, you should reboot your hosts and verify your host multipathing configuration.

In the FLI offline migration process, you must take manual steps from your foreign array to present the foreign source LUN to the ONTAP storage system; then you must take additional manual steps to discover the foreign source LUN on the ONTAP storage system.

Creating the LUN import relationship for FLI offline migrations includes identifying the source array LUNs as foreign in ONTAP, creating and configuring the destination volume to contain the foreign LUNs, creating destination target LUNs, and finally establishing the import relationship.

Use FLI to import LUN data from the foreign array.

Perform a block-by-block comparison of the source and destination LUNs to verify that the migration is complete and accurate.

After the FLI offline migration is completed, the LUN import relationship can be safely removed.

Review logs for errors, verify your host multipathing configuration, and perform application testing to verify that your migration completed successfully.
