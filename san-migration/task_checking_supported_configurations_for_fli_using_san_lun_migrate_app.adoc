. Run the app from a FC or iSCSI Linux host that has block access to the source array.

If the foreign source array can be qualified, a green check mark is displayed. If the foreign source array cannot be qualified, a red X is displayed. If your array does not qualify, you can contact NetApp Support for additional assistance.
