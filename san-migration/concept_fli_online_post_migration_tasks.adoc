Any server remediation not performed pre-migration, is performed during post-migration.

Any third-party software is removed. NetApp software is installed and configured. See host remediation for examples of post-migration remediation for specific host types.

Review logs for errors, check pathing, and perform any application testing to verify that your migration completed cleanly and successfully.
