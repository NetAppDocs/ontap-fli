Migration hosts are rebooted prior to making any changes to their configuration. Before proceeding with migration, verify that the system is in a known good state.

To verify that the server configuration is persistent and pristine across reboots, complete the following steps:

. Shut down all your open applications.
. Reboot the host.
. Review the logs for errors.
