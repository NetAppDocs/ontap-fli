After the FLI online migration completes, you remove the LUN import relationship.

When ready, the LUN import relationship can be safely removed because the host is now accessing the new NetApp array for all I/O to the new ONTAP LUN, and the source LUN is no longer in use.

. Delete the LUN import relationship.
