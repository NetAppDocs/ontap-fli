During pre-migration of foreign LUN imports (FLIs), validate and verify the hosts and source LUN paths. After the host reboots, it is shut down in preparation for the migration.

When migration and remediation are complete, hosts can be brought up connected to the new destination storage, and the applications can be verified by end users.
