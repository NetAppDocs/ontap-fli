In cleanup phase, you collect FLI migration logs, remove source storage configuration from NetApp storage, and remove the NetApp storage host group from source storage. Also, delete source to destination zones. Verification is the point where the accuracy of the migration plan execution is determined.

Review logs for errors, check paths, and perform any application testing to verify that your migration completed cleanly and successfully.
