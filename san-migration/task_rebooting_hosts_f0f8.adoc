You have the option to reboot hosts prior to starting this workflow in order to verify that the host is in a known good state.

Before rebooting your host, it would also be a good time to take a Snapshot copy in order to facilitate a revert if needed later. To verify that the server configuration is persistent and pristine across reboots, complete the following steps:

. Shut down all your open applications.
. Reboot the host.
. Review the logs for errors.
