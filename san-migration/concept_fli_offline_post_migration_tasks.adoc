Any outstanding server remediation not performed earlier is performed during post-migration.

The third-party software is removed, NetApp software is installed and configured, and then the host is brought up accessing the LUNs on NetApp. See the topic _Host remediation_ for examples of post-migration remediation for specific host types.

Review logs for errors, check pathing, and perform any application testing to verify that your migration completed cleanly and successfully.
