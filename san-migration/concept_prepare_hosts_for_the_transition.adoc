The execution phase includes the preparation of migration hosts.

In many instances it may be possible to have performed the remediation prior to this step. If not, then this is where you would perform any host remediation such as installing host attach kits or DSMs. From the analysis phase, you will have a gap list of items that need to be performed on each host in order for that host to be in a supported configuration using NetApp ONTAP. Depending on the type of migration being performed, either the host would be remediated and then rebooted (FLI 7-Mode to ONTAP online) or hosts would be rebooted, remediated, and then shut down (FLI 7-Mode to ONTAP offline).
